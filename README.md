## 🎯 What It Does

GeoTrainr randomly selects a city from a database of locations across multiple countries featured in GeoGuessr. Your goal is simple:

1. You’re given **only the city name**
2. You must **find and click the city on the map**
3. Once clicked, a **new city is generated**
4. Repeat 🔁

If you can’t find the city:
- Click the **“New City”** button **or press `1`**
- The **correct location of the previous city appears as a red target** on the map
- A new city is generated

## 🧠 Why GeoTrainr?

Many GeoGuessr rounds hinge on recognizing a city name from a road sign, storefront, or billboard. GeoTrainr trains exactly that skill:

- Memorizing **where cities are located**
- Improving **reaction speed**
- Building **country and regional intuition**
- Translating city-name recognition directly into **faster, more confident GeoGuessr guesses**

Over time, seeing a city name should trigger an immediate *“I know where that is”* response.

## 🎛️ Training Filters

GeoTrainr lets you set filters to **customize your training sessions** and focus on specific weaknesses or regions:

- **Continent** (e.g. Europe, South America, Asia)
- **Region** (e.g. Balkans, Scandinavia, etc)
- **Writing System** (e.g. Cyrillic)
- **Country**
- **Minimum / Maximum population**
- Combined filters for highly targeted practice

This makes it easy to:
- Drill **only one country or region**
- Practice **large cities vs. smaller towns**
- Focus on areas you frequently miss in GeoGuessr

## Example
Set the filters to European cities with a population above 100,000 - Amsterdam was selected:

Locate Amsterdam on the map and click the circle overlayed on it to advance to the next city

![Amsterdam Clicked on Map](https://i.imgur.com/oLMUZhX.png)

Amsterdam will be highlighted green after you click it - then find the next generated city!

If you cannot find Amsterdam, press the "Randomize City" button or press 1 on the keyboard to generate a new city. Amsterdam will be highlighted in Red on the map so you can learn for next time!
